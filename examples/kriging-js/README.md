# example kriging-js

kriging.js is a Javascript library providing spatial prediction and mapping capabilities via the ordinary kriging algorithm.

Kriging is a type of gaussian process where 2-dimensional coordinates are mapped to some target variable using kernel regression. This algorithm has been specifically designed to accurately model smaller data sets by assigning a prior to the variogram parameters.
